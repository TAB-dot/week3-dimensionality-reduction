Dimensionality reduction can introduce bias since the technique compresses data into fewer dimensions. 
Although useful, the compression can unintentionally introduce bias from loss of important information of minority groups, overemphasis on dominating patterns, and distortion or relationships.

Visualization choices are helpful, but they can affect interpretations in biased ways. 
Summarizing data can hide variation within subgroups and therefore, hiding disparities. 
In addition, the chart type selection highlights different aspects of data. Choosing one chart type over the other can shift views toward certain conclusions. 
Also, changing the scale of the axes can exaggerate or minimize details, which influences how dramatic a trend is.

Diverse perspectives can improve fairness in feature selection by challenging assumptions by questioning teams’ blind spots and hidden biases, 
including voices from various communities to ensure the model accurately reflects real-world complexities, and understanding how certain features might give disadvantages to certain groups.
